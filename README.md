## Purpose

This is my first game that I built while learning Unity. It's very simple and has no UI. But the core game loop is there.

Bookmark my page to stay notified of upcoming games as I continue to learn about Unity and game development!

## Credits

The assets and core ideas were given to me as part of the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D course on Udemy.
